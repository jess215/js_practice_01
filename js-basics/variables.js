// Since ES6 best practice is to use the 'let' label to declare a variable
// Give the variable a name
// By default variables in JavaScript are undefined until they are assigned something.
// You can use single or double quotes, but single quotes is more common

let name = 'Jess'
console.log(name)

// Rules for naming variables
// Cannot be a reserved keyword - if you try to use one of the keywords you will get an error.
// Should be meaningful.
// Cannot start with a number.
// Cannot contain a space or hyphen (-). Use camel notation/case.
// Are case-sensitive

// Can declare a couple different ways, but the modern, best practice is to declare each variable on its own line

let firstName = 'Jessica'
let lastName = 'Nguyen'
